## Syllabus Source
Reference used while building this plan:
- IIT Guwahati GATE CSE syllabus PDF currently published on GATE 2026 portal:
  - https://gate2026.iitg.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/CS_2026_Syllabus.pdf

## Topic Weightage Source (Estimated)
No official fixed topic-wise % is published by GATE. This planner uses PYQ-trend estimates from:
- https://www.careers360.com/exams/gate/gate-cse-syllabus-and-exam-pattern
- https://www.pw.live/gate/gate-cse-syllabus

Use this as direction for time allocation, not guaranteed marks split.

## Planner Model
- **Foundation (Feb-May 2026):** build from zero
- **Core Coverage (Jun-Oct 2026):** full syllabus first pass with regular testing
- **Revision Engine (Nov-Dec 2026):** revision loops + PYQs + weekly mocks
- **Final Sprint (Jan 2027):** mock-heavy plus weak-area repair
